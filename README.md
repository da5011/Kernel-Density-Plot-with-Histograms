# Kernel-Density-Plot-with-Histograms

Hi everyone! This is a simple script I developed that creates a graph featuring a Kernel Density Plot and two 1-D histograms. I use this in my reseearch to help model large datasets. It's very simple to use. Just provide an input at the beginning of your choosing (trivial to change it to a read_csv or read_txt command instead of Excel), and the script will generate a beautiful (in my humble opinion) graph! I have provided some sample data to demonstrate. The output should be the following:

Everyone is free to use this tool without citing me. However, if you do use it, I'd love to hear about whatever project you're using it for! Just to satiate my own curiosity, haha.
